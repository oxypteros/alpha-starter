By now (at the final part of this little trilogy) I hope you have a clear sense of what my goals with **Alpha** are:

1. A clean, inclusive UI/UX focused on text.
2. To be novice-friendly.

The second goal, let me tell you, is easier said than done. To achieve it, I needed to write simple, instructive, and non-technical documentation. But given the nature of the project, it’s also essential to cover technical topics, without making things tedious for those with some or even advanced experience.

My solution? [A tested one](/blog/why-alpha/#first-steps/)! A separate tutorial for Hugo and web novices that gently introduces more technical concepts and eventually points them to the main documentation, which is intended for users with some familiarity.

## For the Novices

By *"novices"*, I mean individuals who are comfortable using a PC, but may have never opened a terminal. People whose web experience is mostly as visitors and terms like *HTML*, *CSS*, *JavaScript*, or *Hugo* might not mean much to them and that’s totally fine.

Alpha is designed to help you **write**, not to turn you into a developer.

If this sounds like you, **start with** [From Zero with Zero](https://alpha.oxypteros.com/get-started/). And if something’s unclear, feel free to [drop me a line](https://alpha.oxypteros.com/contact/).


## For the Intermediate Users

Intermediate users are those who’ve used Hugo before, probably they already have a site and want or need a new theme. But they don’t necessarily tinker with theme files or write complex Hugo templates.

For this group, the [Alpha documentation](https://alpha.oxypteros.com/docs/) will be the main resource for *how-to’s*. Ironically, this might be the group that faces the most friction.

Why? They might already rely on certain Hugo features that Alpha doesn’t support out-of-the-box (like `{{ .ReadingTime }}`) or they're using an older Hugo version that isn’t compatible.

Some of these issues can be resolved by checking the Alpha docs and the [official Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/). Just keep in mind:

> **Alpha’s documentation is a work in progress. It doesn’t cover every conceivable Hugo feature, but rather what I’ve personally tested and confirmed works smoothly.**


## For the Pros

Pros or advanced users are essentially developers who use Hugo for their projects. 

If you’re in this group... send me your info.  

I’ll need **your help with Alpha**, not the other way around.

## A Few Closing Thoughts

Whether you're a dev, a writer, both, or something entirely different, my ambition with Alpha was to create something that feels like home for your content, **not** an obstacle

Whether you’re here to write or tweak the theme into your own thing, Alpha should ideally stay out of your way and let you lead, undisturbed.

So, that's the *How-to Alpha* from my perspective.
**Read. Write. Publish!**

The rest is up to you.
