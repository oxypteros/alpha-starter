This post series reflects my **personal experience**. Your mileage may vary!

I really think it's too late to ask *“Why Hugo?”*. You’re probably already using Hugo, or about to do so. And since **Alpha is built for Hugo**, it’s not like you’re comparing options.
Still, here's a wordy *why I chose Hugo for Alpha* instead of another Jamstack tool or something more dynamic and *“modern”*.

{{< /text_snippet >}}

## A Little Insight

I love to write. You could say it's more than a need and less than a hobby.  
And because all words deserve to be read, I started publishing with tools that promised *everything* (real-time previews, dozens of plugins, infinite configuration options).

At first, during the *“getting used to it”* phase, it felt exciting. But over time, I realized I spent most of my time *fixing* broken plugins, nervously *updating* dependencies, and *digging* through bloat... just to make a small change.

And doing all that for a **personal site**? Way too much.

To be fair, some of these tools are fantastic. They gave more than they took. But they never helped me **just write**.

See, I’m not someone who lets things be. I *have* to tinker, tweak, fix what bothers me. And that led me to different platforms, (*dynamic*, *static*, *hybrid*) all of which I tried. Oddly, **Hugo** wasn’t one of them. I’d heard of it, sure. Just never used it.

## When Oxy Met Hugo

One day, I physically witnessed Hugo build a **huge** site, not dozens, but **thousands** of pages. And it built them *fast*.

Not *"pretty quick"*, but **shockingly fast**. The kind of fast that makes you think something must have gone wrong. But no, that's Hugo!

That same night, I stayed up exploring Hugo. I didn’t know **Go** (*still don’t*), and had zero experience with **Go templates**. 
But in *fifteen minutes*, I had a working website with just:
- One config file  
- Five or six theme templates[^1]  

And more importantly:
- No databases  
- No CMS to babysit  
- No JS frameworks  
- No weird server setup  

And because it was static, it could be deployed **anywhere**.  

Yes, other tools offer some of these benefits. But the total package, **simplicity, freedom, speed**,  I hadn’t found it anywhere else.

Hugo can’t do *everything*, nothing really can. But if your focus is **text**, Hugo is (at least for me) the GOAT.

## Thank You for Nothing?

Did I just use ~300 words to repeat Hugo’s 7 word tagline?

Yes. It seems like it.

Speed might not matter for small sites, a few hundred milliseconds here or there doesn’t change much. But when your content grows, Hugo’s speed becomes something you’ll **genuinely be grateful for**. And while its impressive speed initially caught my eye, and it's often the first thing people mention about Hugo, what ultimately sold me wasn't the speed. 

It was the **simplicity**.

You don’t have to jump through hoops. Just **install a theme** and **start writing**.

Most personal sites don’t need more than Hugo’s *out-of-the-box* functionality.  
But if you do need more? Hugo certainly won’t get in your way.

### And The Cherry on Top

If you pair Hugo with the **Alpha theme** (***yes, shameless plug***), your site won’t just build fast, it’ll be *even simpler* to just start writing. But more on that on the next *why*.
